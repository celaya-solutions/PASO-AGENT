summary: "Use the upstream OpenClaw Ansible playbook as a framework-compatibility deployment"
read_when:
  - You want automated server deployment with security hardening
  - You need firewall-isolated setup with VPN access
  - You're deploying to remote Debian/Ubuntu servers
title: "Ansible"
---

The **[openclaw-ansible](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw-ansible)** playbook is maintained by the upstream OpenClaw project. It installs the upstream framework package, not the PASO source release maintained by Celaya Solutions Research. Use this page only when you intentionally want that compatibility deployment; for PASO, use the [PASO source installer](/install#recommended-installer-script).

<Info>
The external [openclaw-ansible](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw-ansible) repository is the source of truth for its own upstream deployment. Celaya Solutions Research does not maintain or operate it.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Details                                                   |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| OS          | Debian 11+ or Ubuntu 20.04+                               |
| Access      | Root or sudo privileges                                   |
| Network     | Internet connection for package installation              |
| Ansible     | 2.14+ (installed automatically by the quick-start script) |

## What you get

- Firewall-first security: UFW + Docker isolation (only SSH + Tailscale reachable)
- Tailscale VPN for remote access without exposing services publicly
- Docker for isolated sandbox containers with localhost-only bindings
- Systemd integration with hardening, auto-starting on boot
- One-command setup

## Quick start

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openclaw/openclaw-ansible/main/install.sh | bash
```

## What gets installed

1. Tailscale (mesh VPN for secure remote access)
2. UFW firewall (SSH + Tailscale ports only)
3. Docker CE + Compose V2 (default agent sandbox backend)
4. Node.js and pnpm (PASO requires Node 22.22.3+, 24.15+, or 25.9+; Node 26 is recommended)
5. The upstream OpenClaw compatibility package, installed host-based, not containerized
6. A systemd service with security hardening

<Note>
The gateway runs directly on the host, not in Docker. Agent sandboxing is
optional; this playbook installs Docker because it is the default sandbox
backend. See [Sandboxing](/gateway/sandboxing) for other backends.
</Note>

## Post-install setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Switch to the openclaw user">
    ```bash
    sudo -i -u openclaw
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run the onboarding wizard">
    The post-install script guides you through configuring the upstream compatibility package.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect messaging channels">
    Log in to WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, or Signal:
    ```bash
    openclaw channels login --channel <name>
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify the installation">
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl status openclaw
    sudo journalctl -u openclaw -f
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect to Tailscale">
    Join your VPN mesh for secure remote access.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Quick commands

```bash
# Check service status
sudo systemctl status openclaw

# View live logs
sudo journalctl -u openclaw -f

# Restart gateway (run as openclaw user)
openclaw gateway restart

# Channel login (run as openclaw user)
sudo -i -u openclaw
openclaw channels login --channel <name>
```

`openclaw gateway restart` records managed restart intent. For a system-scope service, follow the exact `sudo systemctl restart <unit>` command it prints.

## Security architecture

Four-layer defense model:

1. Firewall (UFW): only SSH (22) and Tailscale (41641/udp) exposed publicly
2. VPN (Tailscale): gateway reachable only via the VPN mesh
3. Docker isolation: `DOCKER-USER` iptables chain prevents external port exposure
4. Systemd hardening: `NoNewPrivileges`, `PrivateTmp`, unprivileged user

Verify your external attack surface:

```bash
nmap -p- YOUR_SERVER_IP
```

Only port 22 (SSH) should be open. Gateway and Docker stay locked down.

Docker is installed for agent sandboxes (isolated tool execution), not for running the gateway. See [Multi-Agent Sandbox and Tools](/tools/multi-agent-sandbox-tools) for sandbox configuration.

## Manual installation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install prerequisites">
    ```bash
    sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y ansible git
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Clone the repository">
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw-ansible.git
    cd openclaw-ansible
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install Ansible collections">
    ```bash
    ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run the playbook">
    ```bash
    ./run-playbook.sh
    ```

    Or run the playbook directly and then run the setup script manually:
    ```bash
    ansible-playbook playbook.yml --ask-become-pass
    # Then run: /tmp/openclaw-setup.sh
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Updating

Follow the external playbook's own update instructions. PASO source updates use the fork-safe [Updating](/install/updating) flow instead.

To re-run the playbook (for example, after configuration changes):

```bash
cd openclaw-ansible
./run-playbook.sh
```

This is idempotent and safe to run multiple times.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Firewall blocks my connection">
    - Connect via Tailscale VPN first; the gateway is only reachable that way by design.
    - SSH (port 22) is always allowed.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Service will not start">
    ```bash
    # Check logs
    sudo journalctl -u openclaw -n 100

    # Verify permissions
    sudo ls -la /opt/openclaw

    # Test manual start
    sudo -i -u openclaw
    cd ~/openclaw
    openclaw gateway run
    ```

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Docker sandbox issues">
    ```bash
    # Verify Docker is running
    sudo systemctl status docker

    # Check sandbox image
    sudo docker images | grep openclaw-sandbox

    # Build the sandbox image if missing (requires a source checkout)
    cd /opt/openclaw/openclaw
    sudo -u openclaw ./scripts/sandbox-setup.sh
    # For upstream compatibility npm installs without a source checkout, see
    # https://docs.openclaw.ai/gateway/sandboxing#images-and-setup
    ```

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Channel login fails">
    Make sure you are running as the `openclaw` user:
    ```bash
    sudo -i -u openclaw
    openclaw channels login --channel <name>
    ```
  </Accordion>
